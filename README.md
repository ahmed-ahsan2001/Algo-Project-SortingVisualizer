ABSTRACT: 
My sorting algorithm visualizer is a user-friendly GUI implementation of a website which visualizes different types of sorting algorithms. It is an easy to use web application which has different functions: first it allows the user to choose the data set of numbers on which the sorting is to be performed and next the sorting algorithms which are visualized using bars and implemented according to their algorithm.

INTRODUCTION:
My sorting Algorithm has ten different algorithms and we are going to visualize them using javascript dynamically. This visualizer aims to provide understanding of sorting algorithms to new users and also to someone who wants to learn and understand how different algorithms work and how they are implemented in our real life and also in our coding world.
PROGRAMMING DESIGN: 
My project is implemented on Html, CSS and JavaScript for both frontend and backend. 

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
To set up my setup I designed different web pages for different types of sorting. First we have the main page which gives us a clear idea about what type of website it is and also has a screen recorded video as well. Next we have a list of options which algorithm we can use and we can select any option and it will illustrate it. 

MAIN PAGE:


SORTING PAGE:

Here we will first choose the data we want to implement using our visualizer which is already stored in our txt file.
RESULTS:











CONCLUSION:
My sorting visualizer is an easy to use interface where any user can learn the different sortings
quickly with the help of visualization and can easily compare the differences between these
algorithms through their running time and space requirements. Each algorithm’s efficiency can
be noted by comparing the time taken by them in sorting the numbers.
